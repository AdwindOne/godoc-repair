## Overview

`godoc-repair` is forked from [DimitarPetrov/godoc-generate](https://github.com/DimitarPetrov/godoc-generate)

`godoc-repair` is a simple command line tool that repairs godoc comments and generates default godoc comments on all
 **exported** `types`, `functions`, `consts` and `vars` in the specified directory and recursively for all subdirectories.

## Explain
* It is necessary to write comments well.
* Tool will only fix some types of comments.
* It is recommended to check the comments after repaired.

## Types
The following comments will be fixed, include type/func/const/varï¼š

### missing name

before repair
```go
// camel case
type CamelCase struct {
}
```

after repair
```go
// CamelCase camel case
type CamelCase struct {
}
```

### missing description

before repair
```go
// CamelCase
type CamelCase struct {
}

//CamelCase2
type CamelCase2 struct {
}
```

after repair
```go
// CamelCase camel case
type CamelCase struct {
}

// CamelCase2 camel case
type CamelCase2 struct {
}
```

### with a colon

before repair
```go
// CamelCase: camel case
type CamelCase struct {
}

//CamelCase2: camel case
type CamelCase2 struct {
}
```

after repair
```go
// CamelCase camel case
type CamelCase struct {
}

// CamelCase2 camel case
type CamelCase2 struct {
}
```

The repaired godoc comments looks like this:
```go
// %s missing godoc.
```
Where %s is the name of the type/func/const/var.
